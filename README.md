# Yelp Dataset Analysis: Restaurant Success Metrics

## Overview

In a competitive market like the restaurant industry, understanding the factors that influence business success is crucial for stakeholders. This project leverages the Yelp dataset to investigate the relationship between user engagement metrics (reviews, tips, check-ins) and business success metrics (review count, ratings) for restaurants.

## Dataset

The dataset is a subset of Yelp data covering businesses across 8 metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada.

## Objectives

1. **Quantify the Correlation**:
   - Analyze the correlation between user engagement (reviews, tips, check-ins) and business success metrics (review count, average star rating) using SQL queries.
   - Investigate the impact of review sentiment (useful, funny, cool) on review count and average star rating.

2. **Key Questions**:
   - Do restaurants with higher engagement tend to have higher ratings?
   - Is there a correlation between the number of reviews, tips, and check-ins for a business?
   - Is there a difference in user engagement between high-rated and low-rated businesses?
   - How does the sentiment of reviews and tips (useful, funny, cool) correlate with the success metrics of restaurants?

## Analysis and Insights

- **User Engagement**: Determine if increased user engagement correlates with higher ratings and review counts.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examine the relationships between the number of reviews, tips, and check-ins.
- **Engagement Differences**: Compare user engagement metrics between high-rated and low-rated businesses.
- **Sentiment Impact**: Analyze how the sentiment of reviews and tips impacts the success metrics of restaurants.

## Summary

By analyzing metrics such as user engagement, review sentiment, peak hours, and the influence of elite users, businesses can make data-driven decisions to drive success. Key insights include:

- **Elite Users**: Collaborating with elite users can enhance promotional efforts, boost brand awareness, and drive customer acquisition.
- **Operational Adjustments**: Adjusting operating hours or introducing special promotions can capitalize on peak hours.
- **Engagement Strategies**: Less successful businesses might focus on strategies to enhance user engagement, such as improving service quality and responding to customer feedback.
- **Expansion Opportunities**: High success scores
